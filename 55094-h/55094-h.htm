<h3>SALUTATIONS.</h3>

<p class="p1">We extend to our friends the salutations of the season, and rejoice that we
can do it with more of gratitude and hopefulness than we have been privileged
to do for many years. Like Bunyan’s Pilgrim, we have passed through the Slough
of Despond, and the heavy load of Debt has fallen from our shoulders; but, as in
the case of the Pilgrim, this is no signal to us, or our friends, for rest in the
Arbor, but for addressing ourselves to the real Christian life-work before us.</p>

<p>1. In this we have many things to encourage us:</p>

<p>(1.) The renewed prosperity of the country puts it into the hands of
our friends to aid us in the needed enlargement of the work before us. We are
grateful for the help given in the dark days of business stagnation, and we hope
that with the reviving industry and commercial activity, gratitude to God and
love for His cause will stimulate the friends of the poor to increased liberality.</p>

<p>(2.) There is a more full realization of the importance of our work. Never before
since the war has the North so well understood that the only real solution of the
Southern problem is in the intelligence and real piety of the <span class="smcap">Freedmen</span>. Every day’s
developments make this the more plain. In like manner the rights and wrongs
of the <span class="smcap">Indian</span> never forced him upon public attention with a more imperative
demand for answer. So, too, the right of the <span class="smcap">Chinaman</span> to a home and
legal protection on the Pacific coast, has never become more clearly defined or
more intelligently recognized. Constitutional enactments and hoodlum mobs
have only set forth his wrongs more sharply and made our duty more plain. Africa
looms up with more distinctness as a field of Christian labor. Not only triumphant
exploration and crowding missionary enterprises stir the Christian heart, but
the very difficulties and disasters arouse new zeal. Our hopeful endeavors to introduce
the colored man of America as a missionary to the land of his fathers
adds a new element of hope and activity.</p>

<p>(3.) The most encouraging outlook before us, however, is in the deeper spiritual
and prayerful interest which our work awakens. Among other signs of this
fact are the aroused attention of the praying women of the North to the woes and
wants of the colored women and girls in the South, the increasing volume of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>

prayer going up from the churches of the North for Africa, and the prayer and
consecration awakened in its behalf among the colored people of the South. But
above all, we believe that the followers of Christ are coming to realize that in this
whole range of work it is only in the Divine arm that effectual help can be found.</p>

<p>2. We have a great work before us.</p>

<p>(1.) In our own special field we have the urgent call to make the repairs and
improvements which we were compelled to refuse when in our great struggle for
the payment of the debt. These can no longer be denied, in some cases, without
sacrificing the health of the missionaries and teachers, as well as the progress of
the work.</p>

<p>(2.) The call for <em>enlargement</em> confronts us on all sides. We cannot meet the demand
in the public mind at the North if we stand still, and still less can we meet
that of overcrowded schools and for new churches in the South. We refer our
readers to the following article for some stirring details on this subject.</p>

<p>(3.) Our friends need to be on their guard against one incidental drawback.
The Presidential election occurs this year, and the experience of this, and all other
missionary societies, shows that such years mark diminished receipts. We can
only say to our friends: Do your duty at the ballot-box, but do not forget the
contribution-box and the prayer for missions!</p>

<h3>OUR ENLARGED WORK.</h3>

<p class="p1">We have been saying for a long time, when we are free from debt we will
do more work, and now that we are free, we have felt constrained at once to
begin the fulfillment of that promise. The great question is to find the just mean
between cowardice and rashness. No organization like ours can say, we will
never spend a cent that we have not in our treasury, for we have to make engagements
amounting to many times the sum at our present command. We
must follow the leadings of Providence not only, but its indications, and rely on
God’s people to sustain us in our anticipations of what they will do.</p>

<p>In our Salutation to our friends, we spoke of the call for the enlargement of our
work that confronts us on all sides. During the struggle of the past few years
for the payment of our debt, we could have but one answer for the pressing appeals
that came to us for more room and better accommodations—an answer
which was hard to give and hard to receive, for those who saw so clearly the great
good that would result from a comparatively slight expenditure of money.</p>

<p>But now that the debt is paid, our friends must tell us whether we can venture
to make a different and more cheering answer to our appeals. These appeals are
coming to us from Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, &amp;c.,
as may be seen by noticing the “Items from the Field,” in this number of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>.
These items were taken without any special reference to this article,
and surprise us, as we glance over them, by the needs which they disclose.</p>

<p>In addition to these, we give just here a few extracts from letters not quoted
in our “Items.”</p>

<p>One teacher writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Our school opened with a <em>rush</em>. It reminded me of the time when I used to
attend lectures at L—. A crowd would assemble, and as soon as the doors were
opened they would press in, each intent on the best seat. So it was in my schoolroom,
each parent striving to get the first chance to enter his child or children;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>

and ever since the opening, I have had to turn away applicants, though they
begged with tears to be admitted.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If our number increases this year in the same proportion as two years ago, in
February we shall have 121 boarders; if the same proportion as last year, we
shall have 134. We can not find room for any such number. From present prospects
we shall reach that number. If anything is going to be done by way of
enlarging this year, we ought to order lumber immediately.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in a subsequent letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We have more young women boarding than we have had at any time before
since I have been here, and several others have engaged rooms. Every room in
the Ladies’ Hall is <em>filled</em>. Two rooms have four in them. Miss E. expects to arrange
beds in the sitting-room. We cannot put four into our 10 x 14 rooms. The
new scholars this fall have mostly come from schools that have been taught by
our pupils, and have been able to go into the Preparatory Department.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still another:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Something must be done for our relief at once. We are overrunning full.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From another the story is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I wonder if all your stations have such increasing wants as this one has! We
trust that our request for another teacher is honored by an appointment. We intimated
that our wants would still increase. This is verified. The question now
before us is this: How much enlargement of this work can you make? Are your
means equal to the demand? Now, we wish that our building were larger by
two rooms; especially so, since many tell us that a large number are planning
to begin school after Christmas. We submit very earnestly the proposal that
we be authorized to rent a building that is contiguous to our grounds, and that
you send a sixth teacher to occupy it. If we do thorough work this year, the demand
another year will require a permanent enlargement of room. We unite in
the most earnest wish that you not only send us the fifth teacher, but also the
sixth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have already appropriated several thousand dollars more than in previous
years upon the Southern field, and that mainly in the work of Christian education.
If our readers only knew the many things we have not done, they would
count the expansion to be very little. Among other things, as was indicated
in the Annual Report, and as is set forth more explicitly elsewhere, we have enlarged
our Indian work, not in the far West, but in Virginia. We have allowed
something more for the foreign field, and added a few hundred dollars for the
Chinese Mission in California.</p>

<p>Our friends will have the satisfaction this year of knowing that their gifts all
go to do the work which presses now; no more is needed to fill up the hollows of
the land through which we travelled long ago. They must not fail us, then, who
have helped us in our distress; but much more, stand by us, now that they have
enabled us to give ourselves wholly to the wants to be met and to the work in
hand.</p>

<h3>PROFESSOR CHASE IN AFRICA.</h3>

<p class="p1">It has for some months seemed desirable to the Executive Committee that an
experienced man, in the carefulness of whose inspection and the calmness of whose
judgment they might fully rely, should go to see for them, with his own eyes, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

field on the West Coast of Africa, the missionary band, and the work it is
doing. The great difficulty has been to lay hands upon a man who should unite
with the qualifications required the willingness and the ability to go. That
obstacle has given way at last, and an embassy is on the way.</p>

<p>Prof. Thomas N. Chase had been detailed from his duties as an instructor in
Greek at Atlanta, where his eminent abilities have been most fully proved by the
annual examinations of his classes, and where his presence has been valued for his
manifold service, for special duties in superintending the plans and erection of
buildings in the Southern field. Some important preliminary work had been
accomplished in that direction, when it was found that the money which was
anticipated for this purpose would not be at the disposal of the Association for
some months. Prof. Chase being thus open to our call, and being the man of all
men we should have chosen for this post, the proposal was made to him that he
should take this trip to the Mendi Mission, and inspect the work. After some
hesitation, but with much less than was anticipated, and regarding the circumstances
and the call as of the Lord, he consented, with the full agreement in his
decision of his excellent and devoted wife.</p>

<p>On the sixth of December he sailed from New York for Liverpool, expecting
to take the steamer thence to Freetown on the twentieth of December, and to
be in the field at Good Hope by the middle of January. He is accompanied by
the Rev. Joseph E. Smith, a graduate of Atlanta, who has been for three years in
charge of important churches in the South, and in whom we have every reason to
place the highest confidence. Mr. Smith will, we hope, conclude to remain with
the mission, although that matter is left to his decision. We believe that he will
do what he thinks the Master wishes. Meanwhile he will do good service as a
companion of Prof. Chase, to care for him and aid him in the accomplishment of
his work.</p>

<p>Important questions as to the permanent location of the stations, the distribution
of the work among the missionaries, and their more complete equipment
will be decided, and with the Lord’s blessing on them we hope for results of lasting
value from this embassy.</p>

<p>It is just the time of the year when such a mission can most safely and effectively
be prosecuted. They will reach the country and have three mouths of the
dry season, if so long a time shall be needed, before it will be necessary that they
should come away. They realize, as we do, that there is always some peril in
going to the West Coast, especially for a white man; but the professor is in his
prime, of sound health, and we believe will be so prudent in all matters of
exposure and of living that we have no great fears for him. And yet, when we
remember those who have fallen, we pray the Lord, and beg all the friends of
Africa to join with us in the prayer, that He will keep these His servants from
harm, will prosper them in their mission and bring them back in health.</p>

<h3>OUR INDIAN BOYS AT HAMPTON.</h3>

<p class="p1">The Association has, after conference with General Armstrong, decided to
make appropriations to aid the Indian work at Hampton as follows: (1.) It
agrees to pay the salary of a teacher, whose time is wholly devoted to this work,
and whose enthusiasm and success in it no one who attended the last commencement
can have failed to remember. (2.) It will support these three boys: James
Murie, a Pawnee from the Indian Territory, a bright boy, who is now in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>

Preparatory Department, and will be able to enter the Junior Class next year; Jonathan
Heustice, a Pawnee with some colored blood, apparently a very good boy;
and Alexander Peters, a Menomonee from Wisconsin, who comes well recommended
by his teachers, and is proving an interesting scholar. (3.) It will
clothe the eight boys from Fort Berthold Agency, sent by the Government last
year, and for whose support it is mainly responsible. The total expense will be
$1,450. We shall be very glad to receive contributions to this work, or for
any of these boys in particular, from those who are specially interested in this
new work of educating Indian boys in our colored schools. The success of the
effort has been so marked, that we no longer look on it as an experiment. It is
the application to this class of the same principle on which we believe the solution
of the great problem of negro citizenship depends. Let us educate the teachers
and the leaders for these races, keeping them constantly surrounded by the
most elevating Christian influences, and they will have great power in lifting up
the masses, who must be taught and Christianized at home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The news of the destruction of Academic Hall at Hampton, has reached the
friends of that Institution long ere this. The origin of the fire is unknown; it
was discovered in the attic, and was already beyond control. In a couple of
hours all was over. An insurance amounting to about three-quarters of the
expense incurred in building will, in the lower prices now prevailing, replace it
to a great extent. Still it is a severe loss.</p>

<p>The value of the excellent organization of the school was made apparent in the
perfect order which prevailed. The honesty and loyalty of the students were
thoroughly tested and triumphantly proved. Only a single day of school work
was lost. About $3,000 will replace the loss on apparatus, furniture, library, &amp;c.
The students lost about $1,200 of personal property. We trust that the friends of
Hampton—and they are many—will come generously and promptly to its relief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our Sunday-schools are in great need of special helps for their work, and that
of all sorts: books for the library and for the service of song; Sunday-school
banners, maps and every thing of the kind. Are there not Sunday-schools who
have such material they have outgrown or laid aside, and which they can send
to us for the dark-skinned children of the South?</p>

<h3>SATISFIED.</h3>

<p class="p1"><i>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.</i>—There are many
motives which combine to urge the disciples of Christ to energy and fidelity in the
missionary work: the wretchedness of those who lie in the darkness of heathendom,
and especially in the black night of savage superstition; the wrongs and crimes
which the introduction of a Christian civilization would in time efface; our sad
anticipations for those on whom we must believe the Lord will look with merciful
and just consideration, and yet who are surely not fit for the kingdom of God.
The fact of the command of Christ were enough, and especially that this was His
last and parting charge. But, amid all these, is there a motive so sweet and still
so energizing as that which we have written above—that in the contemplation of
His salvation accomplished among men, the joy of our Lord shall be full, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>

purpose of His love attained, and He content to have endured the flesh and the cross?
If we love Him because He first loved us, let us remember that His love was not
a sentiment, but a sacrifice; that it was measured by what He did for us, and for
our salvation; and that it is the sacred claim of His love upon ours, that what
sacrifice by us of time, or strength, or means, or life itself, may contribute to the
fullness of His joy, to the completeness of His satisfaction, we should give with
cheerful and continuous readiness.</p>

<p>Other motives may bear upon us with now greater and now less force;
special calls may be heard with more or less distinctness; unusual disclosures of
need may make us eager to relieve; but through all, and under all, and greater
than all, is this, that we may please our Lord, and contribute somewhat to the
completeness of His redemption, and to His satisfaction in the result of all that
He has borne and done for sinful men.</p>

<h3>ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Talladega, Ala.</span>—The Southern Industrial Association held its second annual
fair at Talladega, Ala., November 11-14. This Association is officered in
part and largely helped by Talladega College, and its object is to promote the
industry and physical good of the Freedmen. The weather was favorable, the attendance
was large, many coming quite a distance, and the display of articles was
unusually good. In agricultural and garden products, in fancy articles, in needlework,
both plain and ornamental, and in the culinary department, especial excellence
was shown. The exhibition of stock was meagre, with the exception of
fowls, which were numerous and remarkably fine. Some blacksmith’s hammers,
tables, and an upholstered chair, would compare well with similar productions from
the best Northern workmen. More than seven hundred entries were made, and
the premiums awarded were worth about three hundred dollars. The fair stimulates
industry, and marks a real advance in the condition of the people. Many
of our white friends paid well-deserved praise, and one late slaveholder, said to
have owned nearly a hundred negroes, was so pleased as to make a cash contribution
to the treasury, and offered to double it should there be a deficit. On the
last evening, the College chapel was full to overflowing, while Rev. C. L. Harris,
of Selma, gave a very bold and moving and powerful address of more than an
hour in length, on the African in America. The address showed what an African
can do, and it pointed out what an African should become. Take it all
in all, the Fair marks a good step upward and gives fresh hope for the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">McLeansville, N. C.</span>—Our school is growing larger—double what it was at
the corresponding time last year. Many expect to come after Christmas from
abroad. Must enlarge our accommodations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Tougaloo, Miss.</span>—We now have seventy-nine boarders, and have had to go
into the barracks again. A prospect of increased attendance, and what to do with
the students we can none of us imagine. We ought to enlarge our accommodations
immediately.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Mobile, Ala.</span>—School overflowing. If we have room and teaching force
enough, we shall have three hundred in attendance by February 1st. Without increased
room and help we shall be obliged to turn away many that would enter

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

the intermediate and normal departments. We have already begun this at the
primary door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Atlanta, Ga.</span>—Mr. A. W. Farnham, late principal of Avery Institute, has
become principal of the Normal department of the University, to assist in making
the best teachers possible for that region.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Fisk University.</span>—The number of pupils is rapidly increasing, and there is a
prospect that the students will be too many or the accommodations too few.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Woodville, Ga.</span>—Our school is crowded. If you had not built the parsonage,
the pupils could not have been accommodated. You have done a great deal of
good for the people at this place. Almost every day, children are refused admittance,
because we are so full. The only hope of our church, so far as I can see,
is in the children educated in our schools.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">New Orleans, La.</span>—“I wish you could have heard some of the expressions
of gratitude to the A. M. A. in our services during your Annual Meeting in Chicago.
The church observed the day by remembering the Association in their
Tuesday evening prayer meeting.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Marion, Ala.</span>—In one envelope yesterday,
the collection being for the A. M. A., was $5 from a hard-working
man, this being one-tenth of the man’s crop—one bale of cotton, which
brought $30—showing that your work for this people is not wholly
unappreciated. We made the A. M. A. a special subject of prayer at our
church meeting last week. Sixty-three at Sunday-school yesterday. Boys’
meeting at the Home fully attended. We have had a “reception” at the
Home—all our people, men, women and children, including babies. We only
want the special influences of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Florence, Ala.</span>—On the Sabbath, November 23d, a new church edifice was
dedicated at this place. Pastor Wm. H. Ash was assisted by Field Superintendent
Roy; by student Anderson, from Fisk University, who had preached for the
church the year before Mr. Ash came; by the Presbyterian pastor, who offered the
prayer of dedication; and by the M. E. South Presiding Elder. Fifty of the best
white citizens of the place were present; among them, besides the ministers
named, two other Methodist preachers, ex-Governor Patton and four lawyers.
These friends contributed freely to the balance needed ($70) to put in the
pulpit and pews, which had not yet been secured. It was all raised in a few
minutes after the sermon. The house is spoken of by the citizens as the only
modern church in the place. It is indeed a gem. It is twenty-five by forty feet,
with a brick foundation, a steep roof and a little belfry. It is well painted on
the outside, and on the inside ceiled in varnished yellow pine. The total cost
was $950. It was built with great economy under the supervision of Mr. Ash.
“Howard,” of Boston, is a man who knows how to make fine investments in this
line, as several of his ventures of this kind have proved. To his $300, the Central
Congregational Church, of Providence, R. I., to which Mr. Ash belongs,
added $100. One year ago, more than twenty of the influential and well-to-do
members of this church removed to Kansas, else so much of aid would not have
been needed. We learn that those people are highly respected in the communities
where they have settled. Pastor Ash and his educated wife are greatly devoted
to their people. They are also teaching a parish school, which is much
approved.</p>

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>

<h4>Africa.</h4>

<p class="p1">—Quite full accounts of the Nyanza Mission are given in the last two numbers
of the <cite>Church Missionary Intelligencer</cite>. Mr. Wilson set out August 23, 1878, from
Kagei, at the south end of the lake, for Mtesa’a capital, at its northern extremity,
in the Daisy, but was wrecked on the way, and compelled to take out a section of the
boat with which to repair the rest of it. Eight weeks were thus occupied, during
which they received great kindness from the chief and people of Uzongora, a tribe
which met Stanley with great violence. They arrived November sixth at Uganda.
Mtesa continued to treat them well, despite the efforts of the Arabs to prejudice
him against them. Mr. Wilson had gone to meet the three missionaries who were
coming to reinforce them by way of the Nile. Mr. Mackay was teaching reading
by charts to a large number of old and young. Some valuable conclusions have
been reached by their experience—that they do not need ordained men yet so much
as those experienced in practical work. “Unless we succeed in elevating labor,
we shall get hearers, but no doers. Hence slavery—domestic, at least—cannot
cease; and if slavery does not cease, polygamy will remain.” The need of English
traders to take the place of the Arabs, who want slaves, is emphasized. The cost
of maintenance is very trifling: small presents secure an abundance of goats, coffee,
plantains, sugar-cane, etc. It is hoped that long ere this, seven missionaries
are together in Uganda, viz.: the Revs. O. T. Wilson and G. Litchfield; Messrs.
Mackay, Pearson, Felkin, Stokes and Copplestone. Sixteen in all have been sent,
of whom six have died and three have returned sick.</p>

<p>—The <cite>English Independent</cite> of October 30 says: “It would seem, from communications
which have just been received, that the wiles of French Jesuits have
already brought trouble to these missionaries. A letter of introduction, written by
Lord Salisbury to King Mtesa, was read, and gave great satisfaction. Soon after
the arrival of the Jesuits the aspect of affairs was changed. The king accused the
missionaries of playing him false, an untruthful report having reached him that
the Egyptians were advancing their posts more to the south. Some months passed
in a very unsatisfactory manner, and at length one of the missionaries was allowed
to go to Egypt to prepare the way for the king’s messengers, who were to be accompanied
by Mr. Wilson; two more were permitted to return to the south side
of the lake, ‘on condition that they would thence send on to Mtesa some mission
stores left there.’ At the end of June, three remained at Uganda, without the
necessary facilities either to carry on their mission work or to withdraw. With
such troubles they are beset, through the combined intrigues of the enemies of
corporeal and spiritual freedom.”</p>

<p>—The same paper says that no direct tidings have been received from the London
Missionary Society’s agents at Ujiji on the Tanganika, and ascribes this break
in communication to the Arab slave traders, and only hopes that their hostility
has been limited to intercepting letters. Dr. Kirk, the consul at Zanzibar, has
been instructed to institute inquiries. Dr. Laws, of the mission at Livingstonia
(Scotch), has been requested to send messengers to Ujiji to learn the condition.
Great solicitude is felt, and a day of special prayer for Divine guidance and help
has been appointed. The last accounts in the <cite>Chronicle</cite> of the London Missionary
Society report the death of Rev. A. W. Dodgshun seven days after his arrival at
Ujiji, on the way to which place he lost nearly all the goods belonging to that
part of the expedition, and the successful progress through Ugogo of Messrs.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

Southon and Griffith: they were in good health, and confident of reaching their
destination shortly.</p>

<p>—The <cite>London Telegraph</cite>, of Oct. 22, says: “All alike will be interested in the
following extract from a letter which has just been received from Mr. Stanley,
the famous African explorer, by an intimate friend. The letter is dated from
Banana Point, at the mouth of the Congo River, Sept. 13, and says: ‘All this
year I have been very busy, and have worked hard. I have equipped one
expedition on the East Coast; have reconstructed another—namely, the International—of
whose misfortune we have heard so often, and have explored
personally several new districts on the East Coast. Having finished my work
satisfactorily to myself, my friends and those who sent me, I came through
the Mediterranean and round to this spot, where I arrived two years and
four months ago, on that glorious day on which we sighted old ocean after our
rash descent of the Livingstone. * * * And now I begin another
mission seriously and deliberately, with a grand object in view. I am charged to
open—and keep open, if possible—all such districts and countries as I may
explore for the commercial world. The mission is supported by a philanthropic
society which numbers noble-minded men of several nations. It is not a religious
society, but my instructions are entirely of that spirit. No violence must be used,
and wherever rejected, the mission must withdraw to seek another field. We have
abundant means, and, therefore, we are to purchase the very atmosphere, if any
demands be made upon us, rather than violently oppose them. In fact, we must
freely buy of all and every, rather than resent, and you know the sailor’s commandment—‘Obey
orders if it breaks owners’—is easier to keep than to stand upon
one’s rights.’”</p>

<h3>VACATION REPORTS.</h3>

<p class="secauth">PROF. T.N. CHASE, ATLANTA.</p>

<p class="p1">A stranger could hardly obtain a more
vivid and correct idea of the far-reaching
influence for good that one of the
higher institutions of the American Missionary
Association is exerting, than by
listening to the reports of the students
as they return from their summer’s work
of teaching. At Atlanta University the
first Sunday afternoon of the fall term
is devoted to these reports, and to the
teachers it is one of the happiest and
most inspiring occasions of the whole
year. We wish that many of the readers
of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> could have been with
us on last Sunday, and seen with their
own eyes and heard with their own ears,
since the full rich tones of voice, dignified
composure and simple earnestness
of these student-teachers cannot be transferred
to paper. But I did not see you
present, and so will give you the benefit
of some notes I took down, departing
from my original plan of arranging and
classifying the “testimony,” omitting
quotation marks, and introducing the
successive speakers simply by beginning
on a new line.</p>

<p>I taught in Tatnal. Other pupils were
afraid to go there because it was a democratic
county. People did not want a
teacher from outside of the county, because
they did not want the money to go

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>

out of the county. They liked me very
much. Colored people have from one
acre to 2500 acres of land, and are about
as well educated as the whites. Children
are compelled by their parents to
come to Sunday-school. I kept up a
Sunday evening prayer-meeting. Several
of the children acknowledged Jesus and
<em>turned over</em> to the church. I made two
or three speeches on temperance.</p>

<p>My Commissioner is well disposed toward
this Institution. I made two or
three lectures against intemperance, and
encouraged the people to educate themselves
and accumulate property. At my
exhibition three lawyers were present and
forty or fifty other whites.</p>

<p>The Commissioner did not examine me,
saying that this school was the best in
the world and he never intended to examine
a pupil from it. He was a Saturday-Sunday
man and did not do any business
on Saturday. I tramped a week and
a half for a school and found one on
Col. ——’s place. Parents want their
children whipped, and do not think they
are taught any thing unless they are
whipped.</p>

<p>Some of us had a convention on temperance,
tobacco and morals. The colored
people own a good deal of land and make
lots of cotton. One man made twenty-one
bales, but saved only eighty dollars.</p>

<p>Col. —— said Atlanta University
must be the best disciplined school in
the State. The poor whites do not want
to go to school, and are more intemperate
and degraded than the blacks. If the
colored man would only stand up for his
rights, he would not be <em>hacked</em>.</p>

<p>I taught in a district called “Dark
Corner.” I think I gave them a right
start. Had a prayer meeting which was
largely attended. Poor whites use more
whiskey than the colored people.
Whites seem kind to blacks, lend them
money and horses, and help them in
every way.</p>

<p>I had an average attendance of thirty-three
and a night-school of fifteen.
Taught on an old plantation, on which
there used to be five hundred slaves.
Ignorance has great sway there. People
have good stock, but cannot buy land.
There is a temperance lodge in Camden
of one hundred and forty members.</p>

<p>It was a bad county where I taught.
I was <em>careful</em> about teaching there.
They never had a school before. No
land is owned by colored people. There
is much opposition to their education.
The immorality of the place is explained
by the fact that they formerly had stills
there. Preachers are not moral men.
They are opposed to “foreign” teachers.
Poor whites create a good deal of disturbance.
Land is owned by those who
owned it during slavery times, and they
will not sell it to white or colored.</p>

<p>I was the first lady teacher that taught
in the county and was quite a novelty.
They had bad teachers. One white one
was intemperate. White people were
friendly. Three whites raised their hats
to me, which was quite a new thing.
I had a very good Sunday-school; white
people attended my exhibition. They
like this University very much, and the
Commissioner wanted me to encourage
the boys and girls to come up.</p>

<p>Most everybody uses whiskey and
tobacco. I talked on temperance, distributed
temperance papers and read to
them. Took the New York <cite>Witness</cite> and
read it to the people. I think I did
some good among the children. The
children of the poor whites are <em>knocking
about</em> on the road all the time. They
had a school one month, then gave it up.
Young men spend Sunday in gambling;
guess they are doing it right now.
Some said I was not teaching them anything
because I did not use the blue-back
speller. The houses of poor whites
are just like the colored, but their clothes
are not so good.</p>

<p>The people where I taught are intelligent
and well-to-do. Most of them own
their own homes. The whites want the
colored people educated. A speaker at

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>

an exhibition of a female seminary said
that the colored people were leaving
them in the dark, and if they did not
look out, the bottom rail would be on the
top. Six or eight colored people own
from one hundred to five hundred acres
and stock. The Commissioner’s wife
asked me into the parlor and gave me a
rocking-chair.</p>

<p>Where I was last winter, the people
kept Thanksgiving. Of course I enjoyed
that, because I knew you were keeping it
here. I had a Sunday-school that was
quite large at first, but when big meetings
came on it grew small.</p>

<p>I had seventy-five pupils. I cannot see
that I did much good, but I hope some
good will come out of my summer’s work.
Public sentiment seems to sanction the
worst things there are.</p>

<p>The people where I taught said they
must have a man, that females could not
teach, and they could not stand ladies.
The whites, on the whole, are better to
the teachers than the colored people are.
I succeeded in getting six men to stop
using tobacco while attending school,
and then they said if they could stop fifty-five
days they could all their life-time.</p>

<p>Somehow they looked at me like they
looked at Columbus when he first came
to America. Preachers are all intemperate
men, and some of them said they could
not preach well unless they had some
whiskey in them. I taught four times
in the same place, and have had a larger
school each time. The morals of the colored
people depend on the morals of the
whites. I opened school at eight and
closed at six. I saw no intemperance,
because it was the wrong time of the year.
I talked temperance and acted it. There
is but little difference between the whites
and colored; they eat together, sleep together,
and have the same kind of houses.</p>

<p>Now to these reports, only a small part
of which I have copied, I will add a few
comments:</p>

<p>1. There is no diminution of the desire
of colored children to learn, and of
their parents to have their children educated.
Parents want teachers to teach
from early dawn to candle-light, and
even to <em>beat</em> knowledge into the pupils.</p>

<p>2. Intemperance and licentiousness
abound to a fearful extent, not only
among the laity, but also among the
clergy.</p>

<p>3. The poor whites need education and
moral and religious instruction as much
as the colored people, and our students are
reaching some of them in their influence.</p>

<p>4. Public school privileges in the South
are limited, and it will be a long time
before suitable buildings are provided
and efficient teaching secured.</p>

<p>5. The whites are, in the main, well
disposed toward the colored people, and
in favor of their being educated.</p>

<p>6. Many of the colored people are acquiring
homes and other property, although
in some places the owners of land
will not sell it.</p>

<p>7. In some instances the colored people
are cheated out of the benefits of
their labor, and ill-treated in various
ways.</p>

<p>8. Atlanta University stands high in
the estimation of the people, and needs
liberal pecuniary support from its friends
to keep up its reputation and do the
great work that lies before it.</p>

<p>9. Social prejudice seems to be yielding
somewhat, although the fact that a
white lady invited a colored girl to sit
in a rocking-chair in her parlor, is not so
common an occurrence as to make it unworthy
of mention. Tidiness, gentility,
intelligence and morality will yet be considered
superior to a light complexion.</p>

<p>10. The hope of this race, as well as of
any other, lies in the training of children,
and hence the value of good schools, both
day and Sunday.</p>

<p>11. The American Missionary Association
is doing a valuable work among the
<em>whites</em>, by showing them what education
will do for poor people, and stimulating
them to try to keep the “top-rail”
where it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>12. No one can estimate the influence
our school is exerting in favor of education,
industry, economy, temperance,
Sabbath observance, chastity, social
order, and, in short, morality and religion.</p>

<h3>WOMAN’S WORK FOR WOMAN.</h3>

<p class="secauth">MISS LAURA A. PARMELEE, MEMPHIS, TENN.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">We give the closing portion of a paper
read at the Woman’s Meeting, held in
connection with the Annual Meeting at
Chicago. In the opening portions of
it, Miss Parmelee describes with frank
truthfulness the perils which encircle
the colored girls of the South by reason
of the family habits, the laxity of the
marriage relation, the ignorance of the
laws of health, the late hours of their
religious and social gatherings, &amp;c. We
print her statements and suggestions as
to the remedy and protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of special agencies for training colored
girls to better habits, boarding schools
claim the first place. If there had been
seventy, instead of seven homes of this
kind, we could to-day report a fairer
record of virtue and purity. Under the
constant supervision of faithful teachers,
who regulate the hours, walks and visits
of those in their charge, there is opportunity
to acquire a love for systematic
ways and a pure home life. With the
instinctive imitation of their race they
adopt the manners and sentiments of the
ladies living under the same roof and
sitting at the same table. Yet with this
help, there has been frequent occasion
for teachers to ponder the story of the
young crabs that went from the sea-side
to a seminary among the mountains,
where they became ashamed of their own
gait and diligently tried to learn the
new way of walking, succeeding to the
entire satisfaction of their teachers as
well as themselves, and seeming to have
forgotten the old ways, but, upon returning
to parents and friends at the
shore, relinquished the accomplishment
and walked backwards as in other days.</p>

<p>In two or three schools—possibly more,
but I speak only from personal knowledge—it
is the duty of one of the lady teachers
to give the girls instruction in dress,
manners, morals and health, particularly
in matters relating to their peculiar physical
organization. Once a week the regular
lessons are postponed or laid aside,
that the pupils may have a half hour
for listening to the lecture that has
been thoughtfully prepared for their
exclusive benefit. Commencing with
points of etiquette, dress, sketches of
lives of famous women, announcing the
latest fashion items when they happen to
be suitable, and so winning the confidence
and arousing the interest of the
class, it is comparatively easy to come
to graver counsels concerning morals,
health, danger of association with people
of loose principles, the lowering of standards
of personal honor, and finally the
teaching properly due a daughter from
her mother’s lips.</p>

<p>This branch of work is neither light
nor pleasant. False delicacy, fear of
speaking injudiciously and of being misunderstood
by the girls and their mothers,
too long kept us silent. We shrank
from meeting our full responsibility in
this direction, and nerved ourselves to
the task only when circumstances convinced
us that it was an imperative duty.
The ordinary study of physiology is
good, but in colored schools something
more is needed. Teach young girls to
reverence the body, to regard all its
functions as gifts of God, and the possibilities
of motherhood to be sacredly
guarded, and they are transformed from
animals to thoughtful women. Do any
regard this as dangerous argument?
Those who have tried the experiment
are satisfied of its worth. More sensible
and healthful modes of dress, increasing
discretion of manners and modesty
of deportment, are immediate results
of a plan that a few regarded as an innovation,
but which has abundantly justified
itself. If every well-established
school of the American Missionary Association
could be furnished with models

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>

for this purpose, far more good would
be accomplished than with empty hands,
however wise the teacher’s lips.</p>

<p>These health talks include cookery,
sanitary measures, medical hints, and a
thousand items of common information
in a land of newspapers, but unknown
to people who depend upon neighborhood
gossip for all their knowledge.</p>

<p>As teachers became better acquainted
with the needs of their fields, sewing
lessons were given, or sewing schools
established in connection with daily
work. While teaching deft use of the
needle, to mend old garments and cut
new, there is opportunity to speak apt
words about love of finery, habits of
wastefulness or extravagance, and improper
hours, all of which find quick
lodgment in minds eager for new ideas.
It is no slight gratification to teachers
that, in large assemblies, they can select
their students by a more quiet, suitable
dress and dignified bearing.</p>

<p>House-to-house visiting is another important
means of elevating the homes
and making “life among the lowly”
cleaner and purer. In the early days of
labor for the Freedmen, ladies were commissioned
by the American Missionary
Association for this purpose. It is encouraging
to note that, through the parent
society, the Christian women of the
North are adopting representatives to
carry on this branch of work more systematically.
Year by year there are
changes in methods, and teachers have
less time than formerly for this outside
visiting.</p>

<p>Honorable mention must be made of
the part Congregational churches bear
in this work of regeneration. Too much
time would be consumed in explaining
the opposition they meet, or the great
need of planting this little leaven that
is already moving the mass of blind superstition.
Suffice it to say, that one of the
two denominations claiming the religious
loyalty of the Freedmen insists that,
once in Christ, a soul is forever safe, and
can commit sin with impunity, because
forgiveness frees from all restraints of
the law. The other great body of believers
is equally false in its explanations
of truths held by followers of Whitefield
and Wesley.</p>

<p>These are the principal agencies operating
for the redemption of the colored
homes, and through them for the emancipation
of Africa, latest called of nations,
now stretching out imploring
hands for the light, and health, and
hope, streaming from the cross of
Christ. I will not stop to detail incidents
illustrating various phases of the
one great plan, nor recount successes
attained, nor introduce you to the homes—truly
homelike in peace, purity and
domestic love; or to the little centres of
social influence, where refinement and
virtue invite your respect and friendship.
There are such homes and circles,
although they are not sufficiently numerous
to have the power in their communities
that they deserve.</p>

<p>Between the graduates of Atlanta or
Fisk, and the toilers in cotton patch or
rice swamp—between the better homes
of Memphis or Charleston, and the cabins
in piney woods or Louisiana glades—there
is a great gulf, to be spanned only
by the prayers and labors of Northern
Christians. I have chosen not to paint
prospects and aspirations of the dwellers
<em>this</em> side of that chasm; but rather to
give you a glimpse of life beyond in the
darkness, that you may comprehend in
some degree the urgency of the need to
chase away the clouds that obscure the
light of hope and purity.</p>

<p>I have thought it possible for women
to do more than they have heretofore in
distinct efforts for their own sex; that
some new effort might be made to efficiently
supplement the work of schools
and churches.</p>

<p>Two years ago, we made a bold venture
at Le Moyne Normal School. Health
talks had become popular, and the
teachers were convinced of the wisdom

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

of taking further steps in that direction,
when, most opportunely, there came to
Memphis a lady physician, well advanced
in years, of evident culture, and
provided with an excellent life-size
model of the human frame. She was
invited to lecture to our female pupils
and their mothers, and did so very acceptably.
Her gray hair commanded
respect, although the girls were at first
a little suspicious of the manikin.
Satisfied with the effect upon the students
and of the lady’s good judgment,
her services were secured for a course of
lectures, to which the friends of the
girls were invited. It was a happy
idea, as was quickly proven. I cannot
tell how many times teachers were
thanked for the privileges thus afforded,
or how many mothers exclaimed, “If I
had only known these things sooner, I
should have saved myself and my children
worlds of sickness and trouble and
disgrace!”</p>

<p>Ever since that experiment I have
longed to see a similar opportunity offered
to all the colored women. If a
discreet, motherly woman, who understood
anatomy, hygiene and medicine,
could be furnished with a model of the
body and sent through the large cities
and villages, giving free lectures upon
health, care of their own persons, proper
food, training of children, and responsibility
to God for the chastity of their
sons and daughters, the Freedwomen
would receive incalculable benefit. The
teachers cannot always reach out and
control the mothers; the missionary
meets but a part of the women in a
single city; but an itinerating lady physician
could influence thousands of the
very class most in need of the instruction
she could give. I wish the
heart of some woman, qualified for the
undertaking, would be stirred to consecrate
herself to this work. I think
the officers of the Association would indorse
such a movement. Certainly,
pastors and teachers in the field would
heartily welcome her to their churches
and homes, to which she would be a
valuable auxiliary, while exerting a
more positive and direct influence upon
the women than is possible from any one
of the already established methods of
work.</p>

<p>Dean Howson says: “How can you
convert a country unless you convert
the families? How can you convert
the families unless you convert the
mothers?”</p>

<p>It was once my privilege to minister
to an honored friend who was gently
falling asleep in Jesus. Happening to
draw up a window-shade an hour before
the eyes closed upon the scenes of mortal
life, I received from the beloved lips
this last commendation and counsel:
“That’s right; give us more light.”</p>

<p>Speaking to-day in behalf of our colored
sisters, I appeal for light. “Give
us more light” to dispel the heavy
clouds of ignorance and sin, to show
plainly straight paths for the feet of
stumbling ones, and for the praise of
Him who is able to keep <em>us</em> from falling,
and to present <em>us</em> faultless before
the presence of His glory with exceeding
joy.</p>

<h3>THE GEORGIA CONFERENCE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. C.W. HAWLEY.</p>

<p class="p1">The Georgia Congregational Conference,
from which I have just returned,
is a large body, if an extensive framework
can make it so. My share of the
travel to its second annual session at
Savannah was about six hundred miles.
Of the fourteen churches, two of which
are in South Carolina, all save one were
represented, and the meeting was much
enjoyed by all. The color line was a
little indistinct and almost forgotten.
The colored brethren were quite in the
majority on the platform and on the
floor, and gave good proof of their
ability to preside with dignity—Rev.
Floyd Snelson was our Moderator—and
to speak fluently and well. In fact, they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

showed a real genius for public address,
warranting the statement of a city daily—the
Southern press is growing liberal—that
their speeches were “worthy
of the most dignified deliberative body.”
Dr. Roy reported the great meeting at
Chicago, giving, as he had already done
at Atlanta and Macon, rich skimmings
from the papers and speeches there presented,
and greatly cheering, with these
proofs of the sympathy of Northern
Christians, those who must here learn to
do without the sympathy of their near
neighbors. His lecture on Congregationalism
also elicited much interest,
and nothing but the lack of money to
pay the printer prevented its immediate
publication in full, as a much needed
campaign document for the use of the
churches. To whatever church a man
here belongs, it becomes him to be able
to state and to justify its faith and polity.
There is kept up a running fire of
small arms between denominations here.
It was encouraging to see that the men
of this young Conference desire to be
intelligent Congregationalists, and able
to defend themselves; but it is hoped
that they will not fall into the mistake
of making denominational strife the
chief end of their existence, as some of
their neighbors seem to do.</p>

<p>The reports from the churches do not
show any rapid increase. “We must
expect the churches to be small, perhaps,
for twenty years yet,” said one who has
grown up with this work. There are
obstinate prejudices in the way, and
there is a great educational work yet to
be done. A lay delegate sagely remarked:
“When the ground is rough
we must go slow, or there’ll be trouble,”
adding also his personal testimony that,
in seeking to bring others over to his
way of thinking, he found it “mighty
hard to sense them into anything better
than their old ideas, that a man cannot
have religion without making a great
big fuss about it, and cannot pray without
hollering as though the Lord was
deaf;” but still he was sure that “if we
kept pulling at the wheel and rolling on
the chariot we should gain the field.”</p>
</div>

<div class="article">

<h4>TWO COUNCILS.</h4>

<p class="p1">On the way down to Conference, some
of us stopped at Macon, according to
letters missive, for the examination and
ordination of Preston W. Young, acting
pastor at Byron; and during the sessions
of Conference another council examined
and ordained two others, A.J.
Headen, of Cypress Slash, and T.T.
Benson, of Orangeburgh, S.C. These
three young men passed very creditable
examinations, and, with Rev. J.R. McLean,
moderator of the second council,
formed a very interesting and promising
group—all Talladega men and classmates—a
fine illustration of the good
work done by the school for the church.
Putting all things together—Conference
and Councils, and acquaintance with the
teachers and their excellent work in
Macon and Savannah—it was with us
all a grand week, quickening in its
Christian fellowship, and profitable in
its revelations of work already done,
and of harvests yet to be gathered.</p>

<h3>THE CENTRAL SOUTH CONFERENCE.<br />
<span class="standard">Education—Discipline—The Exercises.</span></h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. HORACE J. TAYLOR, ATHENS, ALA.</p>

<p class="p1">The Central South Conference embraces
the Congregational churches of
Tennessee, North Alabama and Mississippi.
Last week we enjoyed the rare
privilege of welcoming to our homes
some of the members of this Conference,
and the Field Superintendent of the A.M.A.
On Thursday evening, Nov. 20th,
Rev. G.W. Moore preached the opening
sermon from Psalm lxxiii. 24, “Thou
wilt guide me by thy counsel, and afterward
receive me to glory.” The subject
was clearly and forcibly presented.
On Friday morning an organization was
effected by electing Rev. J.E. Smith,
of Chattanooga, moderator. That morning
was spent in hearing the narratives

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

of the churches. The reports generally
showed progress. Athens alone reported
a less membership than last year;
but in this church there has been a
growth in grace in many of its members.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we discussed the subject
of education. The young people
were especially urged not to be content
with a little schooling, nor even with
a good common school education, but
to press forward with a determination
to secure the very highest education that
can be secured. The idea that the
schools at Chattanooga, Athens, Florence
and Memphis ought to be feeders
of Fisk University was well brought out.
These schools cannot give the high education
that can be gained at Fisk, and
their success should be measured largely
by the number of students they send to
Fisk University. Rev. J. E. Smith
read an article on the necessity of church
discipline. The subject was well presented,
and in the discussion that followed,
as in the paper, the idea that
church discipline ought to have for its
main object the reclamation of the offender,
was clearly brought out. Dr.
Roy and others also spoke as to the
method of church discipline, and especially
the propriety of getting evidence
from any source. It seems that some,
perhaps a majority, of the churches about
here will not receive the evidence of any
but their own members. Some think
that Congregational churches should be
bound hand and foot in the same way,
so that the devil and his followers can
manage all in their own way. Then
any member could be guilty of theft,
adultery, fornication or anything else;
if he only were not seen by members of
this church he could remain in “good
and regular standing.” Dr. Roy said
emphatically that evidence was to be
sought from any source, and weighed
carefully. Others agreed with him.</p>

<p>At night Dr. Roy spoke, using his fine
large map, on the work of the Association
in the South. The house was full,
and all were deeply interested. Saturday
morning we listened to a paper by
Rev. G. W. Moore, on how to reach the
young people. Saturday afternoon was
mainly taken up with hearing reports of
committees. Revs. H. S. Bennett and
J. E. Smith were chosen delegates from
this Conference to the National Council.
Saturday night we listened to the news
of Trinity church and congregation.
This was one of the best meetings of
Conference. Sunday morning Rev. H.
S. Bennett preached from Acts ii. 3, and
Revs. A. K. Spence and G. W. Moore
officiated at the communion. At night
Rev. A. K. Spence preached to young
people from Ps. cix. 9.</p>

<p>I cannot give in this paper an idea of
the interesting meetings we had. Each
meeting was a feast of fat things. It
was a great privilege to meet these brethren
from abroad, to have them sit at
our table, to talk with them about the
common cause we all are interested in,
and above all to meet with them around
the table of our Lord. Some of us may
never meet them again in Conference,
but the memory of this good meeting
will remain through life; and we trust
that this church will receive a blessing
in consequence of this meeting.</p>

<h3>GEORGIA.<br />
<span class="standard">Thanksgiving Services and First Impressions.</span></h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. C. W. HAWLEY, ATLANTA.</p>

<p class="p1">I have just come in from our social
evening service of thanksgiving and
prayer for the A. M. A. About fifty were
present, and there were repeated expressions
of gratitude for blessings here
received, and fervent prayers for the
continued and increasing success of the
cause. One brother thought the Association
the chief agent in the abolition
of slavery, and spoke most feelingly of
the inexpressible relief which that abolition
had brought to him and to his
people. Another in his prayer thanked
the Lord for the schools and the church

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>

in the city, expressing the conviction that
if the A. M. A. had not sent its workers
here “things would be in a considerably
worse fix than they are.”</p>

<p>One woman told her story: her blind
gropings as a slave, her joy in being
sought out and taught by the teachers
of the A. M. A., just when she
“<i>did not know what to do with her freedom</i>,”
and made capable of giving her
children, now converted, a Christian
training, with a purpose henceforth
to use for the good of others all
the light and help she had received.
Another told us how the A. M. A. had
reached out its helping hand to him in
this city when he was ignorant and
vicious, and through the influence of a
faithful teacher in a night school had
saved him from evil companions and the
curse of drunkenness.</p>

<p>It has been an intensely interesting
meeting to me, and would have quickened
the zeal of any friends of the A.
M. A. who might have been present.
Our regular prayer-meeting comes tomorrow
evening and is a pleasant anticipation
to me. I reached the field the
11th inst. and am not yet well acquainted
with it. I am sure to be interested in
it. I have quite enjoyed the welcome
given me and have no painful sense of
isolation. Their faces, their intelligence,
their quiet good sense, their homes, so
far as I have seen them, all surpass my
expectations. The work that has been
done for them <em>shows</em>. I shall esteem it a
privilege if I may do something to help
it on.</p>

<p class="secauth">REV. O. D. CRAWFORD, MOBILE.</p>

<p class="p1">It was named after Mr. Ralph Emerson,
a resident of Rockford, Ill., whose
timely gift enabled the Association to
purchase “Blue College,” a commodious
building, with beautiful grounds, in
the western part of the city, two miles
from the post-office. It was originally
built for the education of the white
youth. In the transpositions of the times
“after the surrender,” as the close of
the war is here styled, it became the resort
of three hundred Freedmen. In
April of our Centennial year it crumbled
in the flames. The school went on in
unfavorable quarters until, in May,
1878, it entered its new and elegant
building, which was designed for two
hundred and fifty pupils. Last year the
yellow fever delayed the opening of
school and crippled many of its friends.
But adverse influences are now disappearing,
and the ten thousand colored
people of the city are looking to it again
as the hope of their youth.</p>

<p>Last year, two-thirds of our whole
number in attendance entered after the
Christmas holidays. This year the second
month closes with fifty names more
than the highest number of last year.
The rooms are furnished with the best
of modern desks; but their present capacity
is exceeded by more than forty
names. If another room and sufficient
teaching force be added by the friends
of the Association after New Year’s, our
present number of two hundred and
forty will, in every probability, run up
to three hundred. To meet the wants
of these, we should have six teachers
besides the superintendent, including
one that should give half an hour each
day to instruction in vocal music and
some time to instrumental music. We
now have one that is competent for this
work, but she has no time for it. Our
overworked force is to be somewhat relieved
by the expected arrival of a fifth
teacher this week.</p>

<p>At present we are obliged to receive
many primary scholars, not only to relieve
the public want, but also with the
view of raising up normal scholars, for
whom the Institute has been specially
designed. We regret the seeming necessity
that is laid upon the colored parents
of taking their children from the
public schools. We do not advise their

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>

action. The feverish desire for education
which seized the body of colored
people immediately after emancipation
has subsided. Their best men are now
obliged to urge upon them the duty of
educating their children. In this they
have come down to the level of the
whites. An organization has been
formed to promote this interest. The
largest church has established a school
of more than fifty members. The pastor
of the most influential church, in point
of intelligence, has opened one, with an
attendance of more than forty, and
teaches it himself, in addition to preaching
three sermons every Lord’s day and
performing the other usual duties of a
minister. These schools are intended
to awaken their people in the matter,
and to raise up candidates for the work
of teaching, that may get their fuller
preparation in our Normal department.</p>

<p>The friends of Christian education
could not ask for a more needy and
promising outlook than lies before us.
Will they put into the hands of the
Association the necessary means?</p>
</div>

<div class="article">

<h4>The Church—1876-1879.</h4>

<p class="p1">Organized with forty-seven members,
it now has sixty-one. It owes its origin
and existence to the presence of the
Institute. Its members are very poor
in this world’s goods, but delightfully
rich in grace.</p>

<p>It was natural that the spirit of independence
which found full scope among
the Freedmen should seek for a church
organization and connection with an
ecclesiastical body whose history was
not tainted with oppression. This disposition,
however, has sometimes asked
for more license for fleshly indulgences
than pure Congregationalism permits.
In this city it is impossible for your Superintendent
to find a provision store
having any considerable variety of goods
that does not include among its principal
commodities <em>wines</em> and <em>liquors</em>.
Members and officers of churches are
engaged in the trade, and scruple not
to advertise conspicuously that branch
of their business, which we regard as
exceedingly immoral. Yet there are
some churches, both white and colored,
whose rules and discipline would delight
the heart of a Puritan. Congregationalism
is an exotic in this soil; and its
Northern friends have reason to be
pleased if it grows even slowly. Among
the adverse circumstances against which
our church has had to struggle may be
mentioned a frequent change of pastors.
In its three and one-half years it has
suffered the perturbations incident to
two summer supplies, and now the
fourth pastor. These changes have
tended to prevent some from making
their church home with us. More permanence
is a necessity. We have no
such opportunity for reaching those under
our educational care as is offered
by a boarding-school. The parents of
most of our pupils are connected with
some church, and the children themselves
with Sunday-schools. The kind
of instruction they receive is one of the
necessities of our continuance. The
growing intelligence of the colored
preachers, and the attractiveness of the
large congregations which gather about
them, make our beginning less attractive
to the young, who otherwise might
prefer our place of worship.</p>

<p>Your missionary has preached to the
largest colored church in a revival meeting,
and exchanged pulpits with the
other leading pastor; but we cannot
expect any special help from other
churches in building up a new denomination
in the midst of them. J. H.
Roberts, now in the Senior Theological
Class at Talladega, supplied the church
very acceptably through the summer,
and just before his departure witnessed
the reception of four persons to fellowship.
Since then the attendance has increased
some. The interest in the Sunday-school
has likewise received the impetus
given it by the return of our schoolteachers;
yet our hopes of an increase

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>

in members have not thus far been realized.
As accessory helps we need Sunday
school papers and a library. Our
problem is that of reaching the young
with Christian influences in the form of
direct religious instruction. For this
purpose we have some advantages, and
hope for more. We wish to keep this
missionary work upon the prayerful
hearts of our Northern friends.</p>

<h3>A Revival.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. J. D. SMITH, SHELBY IRON WORKS.</p>

<p class="p1">During the first week in October we
set apart Wednesday as a day of fasting
and prayer. On the following Sabbath
we commenced a series of meetings,
which continued three weeks. Brother
H. W. Conley stopped off here on
his way from Marion back to Talladega,
and preached and labored very faithfully
with us several days. Brother J.
W. Strong came down and labored with
me, preaching the word almost every
night for over a week. Brother Jones,
of Childersburg, paid us a short visit,
and Rev. F. J. Tyler, of this place,
pastor of the Union Church (white),
preached for us. Last of all came Rev.
G. W. Andrews, who preached several
times.</p>

<p>Every evening, one half-hour before
services, a number of Christians would
assemble in the inquiry-room and converse
with those who came to inquire of
the way of salvation. I must say that
the inquiry meetings were the means of
great and untold good, as much or
more than the sermons, perhaps.</p>

<p>Well, the meetings closed with twenty-one
conversions reported. Last Sunday
fifteen came forward, entered into
covenant with the church, and were
baptized, on profession of their faith.
<em>All</em> of the candidates for baptism preferred
sprinkling—the first instance, to
my knowledge, where we did not have
to immerse some out of so many uniting
at one time; and, more singular than
all, a Baptist father and mother presented
their infant boy for baptism.
When reminded by some of the Baptist
brethren that they had “broken the
rules of the church,” they replied by
saying that if they had five hundred
children, they would have them baptized,
because it was right in the
sight of God. The work has a more
hopeful outlook for future prosperity
than ever before.</p>

<p>Some eight or ten are to unite by letter,
the first opportunity, who did not
get ready in time to join last Sunday.
Our total membership will then stand
about fifty.</p>

<h3>TENNESSEE.<br />
<span class="standard">A Student Aided.</span></h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. E. M. CRAVATH, FISK UNIVERSITY.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="p1">Our readers will remember a plea for
student aid made by President Cravath
in the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> for October. Soon
after its publication this description of
the first young man thus aided came,
but has been delayed by the special matter
which has claimed our columns.
There are many more such at all our
institutions awaiting similar help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first answer came in the shape of
a draft for fifty dollars from a good
friend of Rochelle, Illinois. On the
same day with this answer a young man
from Abbeville, S. C., came to Fisk
University for the first time, and as he
was a good representative of the class of
young people for whom our appeal was
made in the October <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, we
assigned him at once to this scholarship.</p>

<p>A brief sketch of his personal history
may encourage some of the readers of the
<span class="smcap">Missionary</span> who are yet hesitating to
give a favorable answer to our appeal.
Mr. Richard J. Holloway was born in
Abbeville, South Carolina, in 1857, and
was a slave up to the close of the war.
He brought to the University the following
testimonial from his former master,
dated Abbeville, S. C., Sept. 8, 1879;</p>

<p>“The bearer of this, Richard J. Holloway,
is a young man who was born in
my family. I have known him from

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>

his birth to the present time. He
early exhibited a desire for knowledge,
which he has pursued under great difficulties.
Notwithstanding he has made
considerable advance, his laudable desire
seems to be unsatisfied, and he leaves
this section of the country to avail himself
of advantages offered elsewhere.
So far as I know, his moral character is
good. He is commended to the favorable
regard of all to whom this may
come.” The first year after the war,
being a lad of nine years, Richard had
the opportunity of attending a school in
Abbeville for five or six months. After
this he was under the necessity of working
with his parents, but contrived to
study by himself so that he made considerable
progress. During the fall of
1875 he happened to see, upon the table
of his minister, a circular which had
been sent out from the school established
by the Am. Miss. Assoc. at Greenwood, S.
C., which was then, and is still, taught
by that most faithful and zealous missionary
laborer, Mr. Backenstose, of Geneva,
N. Y. Noticing that the tuition was
only fifty cents a month, there dawned
upon him the possibility of realizing his
long-cherished desire of securing a good
education. Inspired by this thought he
left home and hired out on a plantation
to earn some money with which to go to
Greenwood.</p>

<p>By working three months he earned
money enough, so that by buying his
food and doing his own cooking he was
able to attend school about the same
length of time. He then went to one of
the upper counties of South Carolina
and taught a private school for two
months, after which he worked for two
months in a cotton-gin near by, while
remaining to collect the money for his
teaching. Being compelled to use considerable
of the money he had earned to
help his parents, he again secured a public
school for two months, at fifteen dollars
a month, and boarded himself. He
then went over into Georgia and taught
a public school, for which he was fortunate
enough to receive twenty-five dollars
a month. He was then able to return to
Greenwood, where he was again under
the instruction of Mr. Backenstose for
nearly three months. Under the advice
of his teacher, he determined to get
to Fisk University if possible and take a
thorough course of study, but not succeeding
in earning much money by his
teaching during the spring and summer,
he stopped for five months of last year
at Biddle University at Charlotte, N. C.
He then undertook teaching again, determined
to earn what money he could
during the spring and summer, and to
get to Fisk University if possible at the
opening of the next school year. He
only succeeded, however, in getting a
three months’ school in Georgia, for
which he has only received payment in
part. As soon as his school closed he
started for Nashville and reached here
on the 7th of October, just as the
answer came from our friend in Illinois
which told us what to do. Mr.
Holloway is a member of the African
Methodist church, and his desire evidently
is to secure an education that he
may use it in Christian work among his
people.</p>

<p>We are confidently hoping that we
shall receive similar answers enough to
enable us to provide for at least a hundred
such young men as this.</p>

<h3>Health—Business—School—Church.</h3>

<p class="secauth">PROF. A. J. STEELE, MEMPHIS.</p>

<p class="p1">November 1st found Memphis dull,
spiritless, and wearing a half deserted
appearance, its streets strewn with autumn
foliage and dry grass, so that the
rustling of leaves beneath the feet was a
more familiar sound than the rumbling
of wagons or drays on most of the streets.
Business men who had returned, in most
cases without their families, wore a troubled
and doubtful look. Many were
discouraged and without hope for the
future of the city, either as a business

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>

point or a place of residence. A few,
like the boy in the dark, made a pretence
of courage by “whistling.”</p>

<p>Although the Board of Health had declared
the fever ended, there were still a
few cases, with constant rumors of
many more. After the cold spell of October
30, the weather became and continued
unusually warm. Little or no
cotton was being received, and orders
for goods came not to waiting merchants.
Laboring people returning to the city
found no employment, and many suffered
for the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>This state of things continued till
the middle of November, when, after
a few frosty nights, and with bright
clear weather, the entire aspect of affairs
changed, and rapidly took on a most
hopeful and promising appearance. Cotton,
the staple and life of business, began
to come in rapidly, until before the end
of November the daily receipts became
the largest ever known at this point,
placing Memphis as a primary cotton
market scarcely second to New Orleans.
With this revival of activity the
empty talk of a hundred or so self-constituted
newspaper correspondents and
pretended scientists ceased to be heard
on the corners and to be seen in the papers.
The city authorities and a committee
of citizens began a careful and
thorough canvass of the city to ascertain
its condition and needs. Under the advice
of a committee of experts from the
meeting of the American Sanitary Association
held at Nashville, a system of
sewerage and general sanitary reform
was promptly adopted, and it is now expected
that the Governor will convene
the legislature to empower the city to
make the needed changes. There is
little doubt but that the hard and painful
lessons of the past two seasons have
finally been learned, and that at least
another epidemic will not be invited
next year by the criminal negligence of
the authorities.</p>

<p>The school opened November 17 with
about forty students. This number on
December 2nd had increased to over 100.
We are now receiving new students
every day, of these ten are in the senior or
graduating class. We note with interest
a revival of the early desire for education
and the culture which it brings;
not <em>just</em> the early desire of ignorant and
foolish expectation, but a steadily deepening
conviction of the need and advantage
of patient, continued study and
training for better things in the future.
We hope to foster this feeling, and to do
what we may to realize the expectation,
by building up honest, manly and womanly
characters in our students. Many
of the pupils have taught during the vacation
months; some have not yet completed
the term for which they were
engaged. So far as we know, all have labored
earnestly to exert an influence for
good in the communities where they
have been located. A few during the
sickness were employed by the Howards
or other societies as nurses, one young
man saving about $200 at this work,
and gaining an enviable reputation as a
nurse.</p>

<p>Our public library is demonstrating
its influence and usefulness in a gratifying
way, in awakening in many laboring
people a love of reading and of thought,
aside from the great advantage it is to
the school directly and indirectly. During
the summer months, considerably
over one hundred volumes were drawn
and read. Among many others several
white persons of most excellent standing
availed themselves of its privileges.
Of these latter, one is principal of a
boys’ and girls’ school in our vicinity.</p>

<p>I cannot close this letter without a
word concerning the church here. During
the epidemic, one of its most earnest,
reliable members fell a victim to the
scourge. By thrift and saving, every
family belonging to the church, except
one only, got through the long summer
of idleness without aid in the way of
charity, and before the return of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>

teachers, and in the absence of the pastor,
the church voted to send a delegate
to the Conference at Athens, raising
money at once to pay his expenses. If
this is not an example of commendable
church devotion and courage, show us
one that is so.</p>

<p>We look for a fuller, stronger school
this year than ever before. I sometimes
think these people have become so accustomed
to adversity and trial, that
they come out stronger under it than
from any other experience. May it not
be that God is leading them through
rough ways to better things than we
think?</p>

<h3>THE S’KOKOMISH AGENCY.<br />
<span class="standard">Homes and Schools—Lands and Titles.</span></h3>

<p class="secauth">EDWIN EELLS, AGENT, S’KOKOMISH.</p>

<p class="p1">The favor of a kind Providence has
preserved us from any unusual calamities,
and general good health, peace and
prosperity have attended us and the Indians
under my charge. It has been
rather a quiet year, with nothing very
startling, either good or bad, to affect
us. Among the Indians generally, their
habits of morality appear to have been
growing stronger. Their general deportment
is very good, and their style of
living in their houses is improving all
the time. Their general health, in consequence
of their improved manner of
living, has never been better than during
the past year. Most of their houses
have been ceiled and good tight floors
put in them during the past winter, so
that they are quite as comfortable as
the average of white settlers throughout
the country. There has been some land
cleared by them, a decided advance in
the kind of fences built by them, and I
have furnished 1,000 fruit trees, which
they have set out, nearly all of which
have lived.</p>

<p>Our schools have been well attended,
and the progress of the scholars in their
studies has been quite satisfactory. The
average attendance of the two schools
has been something over fifty. One
feature of improvement at the Agency,
which deserves mention, has been the
employment of apprentices, at small
wages, at the various shops at the
Agency. We have had five of our former
school-boys employed in this way
during the summer, and they have done
very well.</p>

<p>Among the Indians who live off from
the Reservation there has been an increasing
desire to take up or acquire
land for themselves. One band living
at Clallam Bay, about 160 miles distant
from the Agency, have purchased
a tract of 154 acres of land, and have a
favorable prospect before them of doing
quite well. Ten individuals contributed
the money to make this purchase. Some
other individuals have taken up homestead
claims and are improving them.
One has completed his five years’ residence
and obtained his title to his claim.</p>

<p>The delay of the Government to furnish
the Indians on this Reservation
with titles to their allotments of land,
has operated to discourage them very
much in the improvement of their farms.
They also had reason to fear that there
was danger of their being removed from
here and consolidated with other tribes,
speaking different languages, and to a
distance from the home of their childhood
and the land of their fathers. This
has added to their despondency and
unnerved them for effort. With this
cloud of despondency hanging over
them, it has been up-hill work to induce
them to make sufficient effort to insure

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>

any progress. Their faith in the Government
failing, their religious faith has
also weakened, and while it has not led
them to any bad practices, it has prevented
them from making progress in
Christianity. They reason in this way:
If there is a God who rules the world,
and institutes governments over men; if
these governments are unjust and oppressive,
it must be an unjust God who
causes all this; and why should they
love and worship such a being? This
is the Indian mode of reasoning, and
under the present circumstances there
is a barrier raised in their minds against
the Gospel.</p>

<p>As the treaty is soon to expire, and as
some of the safeguards they have heretofore
had will be removed, it seems to
me very important that this measure
should, if possible, be immediately consummated.</p>

<h3>THE SANTA BARBARA MISSION—CHIN FUNG.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. W. C. POND, SAN FRANCISCO.</p>

<p class="p1">Among the compensations attending
my service as Superintendent of our
Chinese Missions is the annual visit I
am called to make to Santa Barbara;
and, notwithstanding the great void I
found in the absence of my greatly beloved
brother, Rev. Dr. Hough—now
returned to his former flock at Jackson,
Michigan—no visit ever made there was
more pleasant to me than my last. The
movements of the steamers were such
that it had to be an unusually long visit;
and I gained thus the opportunity, not
only to see more of the homes and
hearts of our English-speaking brethren,
but to get much closer in Christian
affection and confidence to the Chinese
who have begun to believe in the Saviour.
Of the six that from this mission,
several years since, united with
the Presbyterian Church, only two remain;
but three others were found who
have never yet been baptized, and who
seemed to give good evidence of being
born again. My conversations with them
greatly interested me. There seemed
to be a simple faith, a hearty and practical
consecration, a readiness to testify,
to work and to give for Jesus, which
certainly looked like true tokens of a
new life—the eternal life—begun. I
expect that they will be baptized and
received into the Congregational Church
at its next communion. The following
sentences from a letter written me by
one of them express what appeared to
be the spirit of them all: “Our school is
grow up nicely, and have very good
teacher now. Only one thing I be very
sorry. I will tell you about. Some
school-boy go to bad way, and disobey
our Lord Jesus Christ. I, in myself,
have no strength to make them to love
Jesus Christ. * * * Oh, I hope you
pray for them, and ask God to send the
Spirit to change their heart, and make
them to ’member Jesus Christ died on
the cross for us, and make them to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>

’member continue in heart wherefore
the heathen too. [<em>I. e.</em>, if I understand
him, make them consider wherefore
they should continue heathen at heart.]
Oh, we are ’member you always in
heart, because you very kind to our
countrymen. I have nothing to recompense
you. But I pray to God for you,
and ask God to bless you and comfort
you, and give you reward in Heaven.”</p>

<p>The anniversary of the mission was
held on Sunday evening, October 26.
A large audience was present, and great
interest was evinced. Besides the exercises
by the pupils, there was the annual
report, and brief addresses by the pastors
of the Congregational and Presbyterian
churches. The exercises indicated
some good progress made during
the year. I remember especially a recitation
of the 115th Psalm, a responsive
recitation of John, xiv. chap., and a
little dialogue about our mission schools,
and what is learned in them—“not only
the English language, but about Jesus
Christ our Saviour from sin.” One
pupil recited the Apostles’ Creed, another
the Ten Commandments, and none
except one or two very recent comers
were without some Gospel text, which,
fastened in the memory, was recited in
intelligible English. Sacred songs, in
both English and Chinese, were interspersed,
and the half-hour was fraught
with blessing, I am very sure, to all
concerned. I have never been so hopeful
of the best results from our Santa
Barbara work as I am just now.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">

<h4>CHIN FUNG</h4>

<p class="p1">is one of our earliest fruits, a bright intelligent
young man whom, years ago,
I invited to become one of our helpers.
He declined on the ground of being too
little acquainted with Chinese, having
had little, if any, opportunity of attending
school in China. But I remember
that he said, “I have wished very much
that I could be prepared to go as a missionary
to my countrymen at home.” I
confess that I did not realize how deep
that feeling was. Such expressions are
frequent among our brethren, and I never
have doubted their sincerity, but I have
generally thought of them as consciously
a wish for the <em>impossible</em>, and consequently
never likely to grow to a controlling
purpose deciding the life-work. But
it was not so with Chin Fung. With
the hope of this he has been saving all
these years, with rigid economy, the
slender earnings of his work as a house-servant.
At length, encouraged by the
excellent Christian lady by whom, of late,
he has been employed, he determined
to go to Hartford, Conn., and commence
his course of study. Before this letter
reaches you, I trust he will be there.</p>

<p>He did not get away without a struggle.
The agony of inward conflict into
which he was thrown by the representations
of heathen kinsmen, as to the wrong
he was doing his family, the difficulties
and calamities in which he might involve
his older brothers if he should thus
turn his back on China, and disregard a
possible betrothal which his elder brothers,
it was said, had made for him, (although,
with this great plan in view,
he had charged them not to involve him
in any such responsibility,) called forth
my intense sympathy. But I felt that
it was the Master’s call to which, these
years, he had been listening, and that to
go back to China in obedience to the
summons of his brothers would be to
turn his back on Christ. He himself
saw it so at length—saw it <em>for himself</em>,
and from that instant there was no hesitancy,
“I will start tomorrow,” he
said, with an emphasis which marked
the conflict ended and the victory won.
He certainly has some qualities which
under skilful training would tend to
make him a useful missionary.</p>

<h4>IN GENERAL.</h4>

<p class="p1">What I have written about the Santa
Barbara school, I might have written of
almost all of them. We have an excellent
corps of teachers, and though one
or two of our schools are suffering

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>

because our reviving business prosperity
involves their pupils in evening work,
others are steadily increasing in size,
and increasing still more, I trust, in usefulness.
At the last communion at
Bethany church seven were baptized.
A much larger number than that have
recently united with the Association of
Christian Chinese, thus avowing themselves
as Christians, and coming into the
process of test work and training, which
we feel to be necessary before they are
finally accepted in the church. But we
need to do much more: to enter new
fields, to send forth more laborers, and
meanwhile in fields already occupied to
bring to hear as never hitherto, the zeal,
the wisdom, the living spiritual power
of Him whose name is “God with us.”
Brethren, pray for us.</p>

<h3>AMATEUR HEATHEN.</h3>

<p class="p1">The small-boy who has been well and
piously brought up hates the heathen,
though policy compels him to conceal his
feelings. He envies the heathen small-boy,
and at the same time looks upon
him as a selfish and remorseless absorber
of Christian pennies. This is natural
and inevitable. The small-boy is told
that his heathen contemporary goes constantly
barefooted, wears very little
clothing, is never washed, never goes to
school, and is never taught anything
that is good and useful. Moreover, the
heathen small boy lives in a country
where tigers and other delightful wild
beasts abound, and where the exciting
spectacle of a widow burning to death
in company with her husband’s corpse—an
attraction which no circus in this
country has had the enterprise to offer—is
frequently exhibited free. Of course,
the small-boy of Christian lands envies
the blessed lot of his heathen brother,
and would give worlds had he, too, been
born a heathen. Now, when this envious
small-boy is compelled to give 50
per cent. of his pennies to the heathen,
he feels that it is both unreasonable and
unjust, and his anger burns against the
heathen small-boy who, although rolling
in every kind of heathen luxury, meanly
absorbs the scant wealth of small-boys
who have had the misfortune to be born
in Christian countries. He cannot avoid
noticing that the grown-up folks who
think that he should give one-half of
his pennies to the heathen, do not divide
their own property in that way, and he
never drops a copper in the collector’s
box without feeling that he is the victim
of moral blackmailing.</p>

<p>Now and then there arises a small-boy
with a gigantic intellect, and a degree
of courage which marks him as a born
leader of his race. It is the exceptional
small-boy of this variety who heads
expeditions against the Indians and
organizes gangs of juvenile highwaymen.
That these enterprises do not meet with
success is due to forces beyond his control,
but they display the greatness of
his intellect and the boldness of his
character. Of this type of small-boy is
Master Jaggars, of North Meriden,
Conn., who lately devised an ingenious
and entirely novel scheme for arresting
the flow of American copper coins toward
the heathen pockets of juvenile India.</p>

<p>Some two months since, Master Jaggars,
who had painfully accumulated the sum
of twenty-five cents, with a view to an
expected circus, was compelled to consecrate
fifteen cents to the hated small-boys
of India. It was this last of a long
series of pecuniary outrages that determined
him to take a bold stand against
missionary assessments, and he, therefore,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

summoned a mass-meeting of small-boys
on Saturday afternoon at Deacon
Pratt’s barn, ostensibly with a view to
rats, but really in order to propose a
plan of defense against heathen encroachments.</p>

<p>Master Jaggars made a moving speech,
in which he glowingly described the
luxury in which the heathen small-boy
wallows. “He ain’t washed, and he
can wear just as little cloze as hesermineter.
There ain’t no school for him, nor
no Sunday, you bet. He can go
swimmin’ every day, and can just lay
off on the bank and see the crocodiles
scoop in washerwomen and such.
Then his back yard is chuck full of
tigers and hipopomusses, and no end of
snakes, and he can steal his dad’s gun
and shoot ’em out of the back window.
This is the chap that rakes in all our
money, and I say its mor’n we ought to
stand. Now, I move that we all turn
heathen ourselves. The folks can’t
make us wash and go to school if we’re
heathen, and all the other boys will have
to put up their money for us.” It is
needless to say that this speech was received
with tumultuous applause. Howls
of execration went up as the luxuries of
the hated heathen were described, and
the proposal to adopt heathenism as a
profession was unanimously supported.
A slight temporary opposition was
manifested by Master Sabin, who maintained
that in order to become heathen
they must first have their eyes put out—a
theory which was based upon a misinterpretation
of the hymn which speaks
of “the heathen in his blindness.” The
objector, however, was soon convinced
of his error, and expressed thereupon
a hearty desire to become a heathen.</p>

<p>The details of the scheme were all arranged
by Master Jaggars. A plaster
bust of Mr. S. J. Tilden was decided to be
ugly enough to serve as an idol, and the
amateur heathen placed it on an empty
barrel in the barn, and bowed down to
it with much gravity. They discarded
all their clothing except a towel twisted
around the waist, and blackened their
entire bodies with burnt cork. There
could be no doubt that they were very
successful heathen in appearance, and,
as it was late in the afternoon, they resolved
to spend the night in the barn;
to breakfast on the spoils of Deacon
Pratt’s orchard, and to attend Sunday-school
in a body, in order to collect
tribute from the Christian boys. The
Sunday-school opened as usual the next
morning, although the absence of eleven
boys created a good deal of remark.
Soon after the exercises had begun, the
teachers were astounded at the entrance
of Master Jaggars and his ten associate
heathen. It is only fair to say that the
heathen behaved themselves with as
much propriety as their professional duties
would permit. Master Jaggars advanced
to the Superintendent and remarked,
“If you please, Sir, we’ve all
turned heathen. There ain’t no foolin’
about it. We’ve got a first-class old
idol, and we don’t believe in nothing no
more. So, if you please, Sir, will you
please tell them Christian boys to fork
over half of all the money they’re got,
and to remember how blessed it is to
consecrate it to real genuine heathen.”</p>

<p>There is no instance on record in
which a heathen has been converted as
quickly as was Master Jaggars. The
Superintendent held him by one ear,
and at the tenth stroke of the cane
Mister Jaggars renounced his heathenism
and promised to smash his idol and return
to the Christian faith without a moment’s
delay. The other heathen, alarmed
by the fate of their leader, fled to the
barn, washed themselves, resumed their
clothing, and went homeward with
sober countenances, singing missionary
hymns. The North Meriden revival of
heathenism was a disastrous failure, but
nevertheless the boldness and originality
of the scheme devised by Master
Jaggars must command our wonder
and admiration.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p class="drop-cap">THE <span class="smcap">Tribune</span> is conceded by eminent men in this country and Europe to be “<span class="smcap">The Leading
American Newspaper.</span>” It is now spending more labor and money than ever before to
deserve that pre-eminence. It secured and means to retain it by becoming the medium of
the best thought and the voice of the best conscience of the time, by keeping abreast of <em>the
highest progress</em>, favoring <em>the freest discussion</em>, hearing all sides, appealing always to <em>the best
intelligence</em> and <em>the purest morality</em>, and refusing to cater to the tastes of the vile or the prejudices
of the ignorant.</p>

<p class="large center"><i><b>Premiums for 1879-’80.—Extraordinary Offers.</b></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tribune</span> has always dealt liberally with its friends who have used their time and influence
in extending its circulation, but it now announces a Premium List surpassing in liberality
any heretofore offered by any newspaper. We take pleasure in calling attention to the following:</p>

<p class="large center"><b>THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE,</b></p>

<p>Being the last (1879) edition of <span class="smcap">Chambers’s Encyclopædia</span>, a Dictionary of Universal Knowledge
for the People, complete and Unabridged, with large additions upon topics of special
interest to American readers, in twenty volumes, the first fourteen comprising the exact and
entire test of Chambers’s Encyclopædia, omitting only the cuts, and the last six containing
several thousand topics not found in the original work, besides additional treatment of many
there presented. This portion is designed to meet the special wants of American readers,
supplying the natural deficiencies of the English work.</p>

<p>The twenty volumes will actually contain <em>over 12 per cent more matter than Appleton’s
Cyclopædia</em>, which sells at <em>eighty dollars</em>!</p>

<p>Two of the volumes are now ready for delivery, the third is in press and will be ready in a
few days, and then they will be issued at the rate of two volumes per month until the entire
twenty volumes are completed, which will be about August or September, 1880.</p>

<p>We offer this valuable work on the following terms:</p>

<p><b>For $12.</b>—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., substantially bound in
cloth, and <span class="smcap">The Weekly Tribune</span> 5 years to one subscriber.</p>

<p><b>For $18.</b>—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., as above, and the <span class="smcap">Semi-Weekly
Tribune</span> 5 years.</p>

<p><b>For $18.</b>—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., as above, and ten copies
of <span class="smcap">The Weekly Tribune</span> one year.</p>

<p><b>For $27.</b>—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., as above, and twenty
copies of <span class="smcap">The Weekly Tribune</span> one year.</p>

<p><b>For $26.</b>—THE LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE, 20 vols., as above, and <span class="smcap">The
Daily Tribune</span> 2 years.</p>

<p>The books will in all cases be sent by mail, express or otherwise as the subscriber may
direct, at his expense, but with no charge for packing. We shall begin sending them in the
order in which subscriptions have been received on the 1st of January, 1880, when certainly
five and probably six volumes will be ready, and shall send thenceforward as subscribers
may direct.</p>

<p>THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE will send at the subscriber’s expense for freight, or deliver

<p>When the fact is considered that <span class="smcap">The Weekly Tribune</span>, both in the quantity and the
quality of its reading matter, is the equal of any and the superior of most of the $3 and $4
literary and religious papers, and that the <span class="smcap">Semi-Weekly</span> contains twice as much reading
matter every week as <span class="smcap">The Weekly</span>, this reduction in price is one of the most notable

<p class="p1">We have been gratified with the constant tokens of the increasing appreciation of
the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> during the year now nearly past, and purpose to spare no effort to
make its pages of still greater value to those interested in the work which it records.</p>

<p>Shall we not have a largely increased subscription list for 1880?</p>

<p>A little effort on the part of our friends, when making their own remittances, to
induce their neighbors to unite in forming Clubs, will easily double our list, and thus
widen the influence of our Magazine, and aid in the enlargement of our work.</p>

<p>Under the editorial supervision of Rev. <span class="smcap">Geo. M. Boynton</span>, aided by the steady
contributions of our intelligent missionaries and teachers in all parts of the field, and
with occasional communications from careful observers and thinkers elsewhere, the
<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> furnishes a vivid and reliable picture of the work going forward
among the Indians, the Chinamen on the Pacific Coast, and the Freedmen as
citizens in the South and as missionaries in Africa.</p>

<p>It will be the vehicle of important views on all matters affecting the races among
which it labors, and will give a monthly summary of current events relating to their
welfare and progress.</p>

<p>Patriots and Christians interested in the education and Christianizing of these
despised races are asked to read it, and assist in its circulation. Begin with the next
number and the new year. The price is only Fifty Cents per annum.</p>

<p>The Magazine will be sent gratuitously, if preferred, to the persons indicated on
page 412, December Number.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
